# All possible connected graphs
A recursive algorithm devised to calculate the number of all the possible connected graphs with n nodes.

ðŸ“’ A full mathematical explanation can be found [`explanation.pdf`](https://github.com/MrPio/All-Possible-Connected-Graphs/blob/main/explanation.pdf)

ðŸŽ² A collection of the obtained results can be found [`results.txt`](https://github.com/MrPio/All-Possible-Connected-Graphs/blob/main/results.txt), and can be compared with Oasis official samples https://oeis.org/A001187/list

ðŸ’Ž An implementation of the much faster and more graceful Harary Palmer recursive algorithm can be found in [`harary_palmer.py`](https://github.com/MrPio/All-Possible-Connected-Graphs/blob/main/harary_palmer.py)
